Stock Dashboard and Prediction Tool
Developed an interactive, AI-driven Stock Dashboard and Prediction Tool using Python and libraries like Streamlit, TensorFlow, and Plotly. The project features real-time stock data visualization, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis using news data, and stock price prediction leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model. Key highlights include:
	•	Dynamic Visualizations: Created interactive charts for stock price trends and moving averages.
	•	Financial Analysis: Integrated balance sheets, income statements, and dividend data via Alpha Vantage API.
	•	Sentiment Insights: Incorporated news sentiment analysis using StockNews API for informed decision-making.
	•	Prediction Models: Implemented LSTM-based stock price prediction with data preprocessing and scalability.
	•	Enhanced UI/UX with customized theming and styling for professional presentation.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visualization, API integration, machine learning, and full-stack deployment using Streamlit.
